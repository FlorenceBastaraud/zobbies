The SPA was done with Vanilla javascript (as a I wanted to challenge myself to build a framework free SPA) and the styling with SASS. Express was used to serve the index.html file for all url resquests to allow the custom client side routing. I also used Express for the server side API. I choose Mongoose to communicate with the mondodb database and for the websockets, I picked Socket Io.
